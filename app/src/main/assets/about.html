        <p>When a company grows in size and the number of employees increase,
            keeping track of all employees might become a problem.</p>
        <p>This problem is something that the HR-Department here at Intended-nihility have been struggling with for a while now,
            which have lead to the development of this application and tool.</p>
        <p>The application is designed to increase the efficiency and decrease the required workload of the HR-Departments everyday tasks,
            by providing a clean and easy way to browse the basic information about the employees,
            like contact information and position etc.</p>
